<!-- This is the first lab in module one which makes sure I understand using anchor tags together with Ids to transition from one setinon to another
        Things done in this lab:
        1. Created internal links within a webpage so that users can navigate directly to specific sections or elements of the page using the ID attribute of the anchor tag.
        2. Created sections within the webpage that can be linked to by assigning unique ID attributes to the sections.
        3. Created hyperlinks at other locations within the same page that point to these sections by setting the href attribute of the anchor tag to the ID attribute of the target section, prefixed by the hashtag symbol.
        4. Explained how clicking on the anchor link navigates to the corresponding section within the webpage.
        5. Added descriptions for specific items in a shopping list and linked them using internal hyperlinks.
