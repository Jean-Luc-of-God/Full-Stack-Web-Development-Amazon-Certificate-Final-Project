            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>To provide quality content and resources to our users.</p>   
            <p>You will often need to create internal links within a webpage so that users can navigate 
                directly to specific sections or elements of the page. The ID attribute of the anchor tag 
                provides a way to link specific sections within a webpage. First, you need to create a section
                 within your webpage that you want to be linked to. Then you assign a unique ID attribute to the section.
                  Once this has been done, you can create a hyperlink at any other location within the same page that points
                   to this section. To do this, set the href attribute of the anchor tag to the ID attribute of the target 
                   section, prefixed by the hashtag symbol, which is used for anchor IDs, followed by the value of the ID. 
                   When the anchor link is clicked, the browser navigates the corresponding section within the webpage.
                    Now let's explore adding these types of links to the shoppinglist website. You already have the list of 
                    items available in the shoppinglist.html. Now let's add a paragraph as a description of the apples item.
                     Inside the P tag, assign apples as the ID attribute. This paragraph can now be linked to the li in angle 
                     brackets item, apples in the list of fruits. To create a hyperlink around the word apples, use the anchor 
                     tag with its href attribute set to hash apples, the ID of the paragraph below. Type inside angle brackets,
                      li a href equals hash apples. Apples closing a tag, closing li tag. When opening the page, shoppinglist.
                      html is opened in the browser. You will see a hyperlink around the word apples pointing to the internal 
                      hyperlink.
                 Click on the link. The browser scrolls down to the paragraph describing the item apples in the shoppinglist. 
                 You can also use hash top to create a hyperlink to take the browser to the top of the page by typing
                  inside angle bracket h2, a href hash top, back to the top of page, closing a tag, closing h2 tag.</p>
